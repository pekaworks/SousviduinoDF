# SousviduinoDF


This is an SousViduino code (made by Adafruit) port made to be usable on Arduino with the DFRobot LCD shield. Additional state output is displayed using three state LEDs. Shift button configured to be toggle on/off as DFRobot buttons use an ADC to work and it doesn't register two buttons pressed at the same time.
